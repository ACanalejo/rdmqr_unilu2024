# Introduction

## About me

-   Postdoctoral researcher at the project [DIGIPOL](https://www.unilu.ch/en/faculties/faculty-of-humanities-and-social-sciences/institutes-departements-and-research-centres/department-of-political-science/research/digitalization-and-political-conflict-parties-voters-and-electoral-alignment-digipol/#section=c122045)

-   PhD in Political and Social Sciences from the [EUI](https://www.eui.eu/en/home)

-   Interested in **political behaviour**, **comparative politics**, **democratic attitudes and preferences**, **quantitative methods**

-   Originally from the [city with the most UNESCO heritage sites in the world](https://www.architecturaldigest.com/story/cordoba-spain-has-most-unesco-world-heritage-sites)

-   You can find more information about me in [my personal website](https://acanalejo.github.io/)

## Is it enough with collecting data and having the power to analyze it?

. . .

<br>

**No! Science is all about** [**design**]{style="color:red;"}**!**

. . .

- The goal is to make **inferences** about the world on the basis of empirical information

- To make the right inferences, **methods and rules** are crucial

- This course is about these rules and methods, and how to **apply** them, with a focus on **quantitative research**

## In what topics are you interested?

![](topics.png){fig-align="center"}

## Learning outcomes

1. ...understand the logic of quantitative social science.

2.  ...understand and critically assess quantitative research articles.

3. ...identify an appropriate and feasible research design for a given research problem.

4. ...communicate complex concepts effectively to a broad audience.

5. ...perform simple descriptive and inferential statistical analyses.

# The course organization

## Teaching policy

This is a **seminar**, not a lecture!

Therefore, active participation is the most important tool:

- No slides

- Comments and doubts about the readings to be brought **in advance**

- **Readings questions** every week

- At least one **presentation** by student

## Integration and interaction policy

- No discrimination

- Inclusive language

- No bullying

- **Everyone** should participate in equal terms

## Artificial intelligence (AI) policy

- AI tools, like ChatGPT, are allowed

- They should augment, not replace, human work

- Mandatory declaration policy

## Evaluation I

1. Attend all the sessions 

2. Study the mandatory readings before each session 

    - Focus on the basic readings

3. Participate actively

4. Answer the reading questions of each session 

    - Specific folder in OLAT
    
    - To be uploaded the day before the class

## Evaluation II
   
5. Presentation of the supplementary readings

    - Organization at the end of this class
    
    - It should have: an introduction, researh design review, and research design proposal (more in the syllabus)

6. Complete three take-home exercises

    - Second half of the course (from October 31st)
    
    - Empirical applications (perform statistical analyses with real data using R)
    
## 

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.width=6, fig.height=3, fig.align = "center"}
# Load necessary library
library(ggplot2)

# Data for grading policy
grades <- data.frame(
  Category = c("Reading Questions", "Class Participation", "Take-home Exercises", "Presentation"),
  Percentage = c(10, 20, 30, 40)
)

# Reorder the levels of Category based on Percentage from higher to lower
grades$Category <- factor(grades$Category, levels = grades$Category[order(-grades$Percentage)])

# Create a bar chart
ggplot(grades, aes(x = reorder(Category, -Percentage), y = Percentage, fill = Category)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  geom_text(aes(label = paste0(Percentage, "%")), vjust = -0.5) +  # Add percentage labels
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Grading Policy Breakdown", x = "Category", y = "Percentage") +  # Remove x-axis label
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Set2") +
  ylim(0,50) +
  theme(legend.position = "right",  # Add legend for categories
        legend.title = element_blank(),  # Remove legend title
        axis.text.x = element_blank(),  # Remove x-axis text
        plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))  # Center title
```

## Masterseminar paper

- Between 7000 and 9000 words

- Topic to be agreed with the lecturer

- Paper outline of 1-2 by **December 1st 2024**

    -	Introduction of the topic

    -	Research question

    - Academic and societal relevance

    -	Theory and hypotheses

    -	Approach and structure of the paper

## Office and tutor hours

No **office hours**; send an email to the lecturer ([alvaro.canalejo@unilu.ch](alvaro.canalejo@unilu.ch)) to schedule a meeting one week in advance.

**Tutor** for quick doubts and questions. Also, "tutorial classes" to help completing the take-home exercises on **Tuesdays from 16:00 to 17:30** starting on **November 5th** *(Hörsaal HS 2)*.
